This repository contains resources for the Course [Open Source Software Development for Astronomy](https://ufind.univie.ac.at/en/course.html?lv=450102&semester=2023W), taught during winter semester 2023 at the University of Vienna.

The aim of this course (inspired by the [Code/Astro](https://semaphorep.github.io/codeastro/) workshops) was to enable MSc/PhD students in astronomy to build and release open source software packages. They produced the following software repositories:
