# Stella's Stellar Software Super Surprise: The Return of Lumo!

Hello. This is a story. A great one!

Stella, a young girl who loved stargazing, had an extraterrestrial encounter one clear 
night. A shooting star named Lumo landed in her garden on a pink magical unicorn.

From the spaceship a little squishy turquoise creature, in the 
shape of a shooting star emerged. It introduced itself as Luna from Proxima Centauri b.

Lumo (AKA Shepard or Halley) had a couple of special tasks for Stella. Stella eagerly agreed to help, 
using her creativity and love for the stars. First to create a software 
for astronomers and second, to observe Lumo's favourite planet Beltamesh 
with her brand new telescope.

Together, they developed "StellaSky," a powerful tool for astronomers to explore
the cosmos. They shared it with their town and the world.

Stella's love for the stars and magical technical abilities, combined with Lumo's magic, proved that even a 
young girl could make a big impact in astronomy. Stella's stellar software 
changed the way people saw the universe, lighting up the night sky for 
generations to come.

Until darkness came forever. But then a giraffe arrived, with lots of friends!
And the lived happily ever after :)
Actually, I don't like the happy ending...
Bla bla bla
